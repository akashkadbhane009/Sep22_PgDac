methods ‘area’, ‘draw’, ‘rotate’, ‘move’ etc. Now create two classes “Circle” and “Rectangle” that
implement this ‘Shape’ interface and implement the methods ‘area’, ‘move’, etc. Write a main() function
to create two “Circle” and three “Rectangle”,then move them. Print the details of circles and rectangles
